1. Identify the error in the following program.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int i = 0;
    i = i + 1;
    cout << i;
    return 0;
}


2Identify the  error in the following program-*
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    short i = 2500, j = 3000;
    cout << "i+j " << i + j;
    return 0;
}

3 What will happen if we run this program?
There are several errors in the given program:

The header file should be included as #include <iostream> instead of #Include<iostream.h>.

The main function should have a return type of int instead of void.

The variable f is declared as an int, but is initialized with a floating-point value 1.0, which may lead to a loss of precision.

The variable modResult is initialized with an incorrect expression i%jj, which should be i % j.

The variable inadResult and divresult are not used in the program and can be removed.

The variable modresult should be written with uppercase M as modResult.

4 Find errors., if any in the following C++ statements
a.cout << "x=" << x;

b.m = 5; // n = 10; // s = m;

c. cin >> x >> y;

d. cout<<“\nName”<<name;

e. cout<<”enter the value”;
   cin>>x;

f.  /* addition */ z=x+y;
