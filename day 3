1)

The program is missing a space between "int" and "main" in the function declaration. It should be:
#include<iostream>
int main()
{
    cout<< "\"geeksforgeeks\"";
    return 0;
}

2)
The output of the program will be "x is equal to y". The expression !(x ^ y) is equivalent to (x == y), so the if statement will evaluate to true because x and y have the same value.

3}
The program will output the numbers from 1 to 10 repeatedly until the call stack overflows, because the condition in the if statement is always true. The static variable x is initialized to 1 and incremented with each recursive call to main(). The expression (cout<< x << " "&& x++ < N &&main()) will print the value of x, increment it, and then call main() again if x is less than N. The expression always returns true because the output stream object cout evaluates to true.

4}
The variable y is assigned the value "seventy", which is not a valid integer literal. This will cause a compilation error. If we fix the typo and assign y the value 70, then the program will swap the values of x and y using a temporary variable:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    int y = 70;

    int temp = x;
    x = y;
    y = temp;

    cout<< "X : "<< x << "\n";
    cout<< "Y : "<< y << "\n";

    return 0;
}


The output will be:

X : 70
Y : 10


5}
Yes, we can use the header file bits/stdc++.h in C++ if our compiler supports it. It includes all standard C++ headers and some non-standard ones, and can simplify our code by reducing the number of header files we need to include. The program computes the maximum and minimum of two integers a and b using the formula (a+b+abs(a-b))/2 and (a+b-abs(a-b))/2, respectively:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a = 15, b = 20;
    printf("max = %d\n", ((a + b) + abs(a - b)) / 2);
    printf("min = %d", ((a + b) - abs(a - b)) / 2);
    return 0;
}
The output will be:

max = 20
min = 15

6}
The output of the program will be 10, which is the sum of a and b. The expression -( -a-b ) is equivalent to a + b because the double negative cancels out.

7}
The output of the program will be "SIMATS". The expression !(cout<< "SIMATS") will print "SIMATS" to the output stream cout and return false, so the if statement will execute the else block and print nothing.

8}
The output of the program will be 1. The variable n is initialized to 4 and then right-shifted by 2 bits, which is equivalent to integer division by 2^2 = 4. Therefore, n becomes 1.
