1.  What will happen when you execute the following cvde?
#inlcude<iostream.h>
void main()
int i =0;
i =400*400/400
cout<<I;

output: 400.


2. Identify the error in the following program_
Include<iostrearn..h>
void main()
 {
Int num[] ={1,2,3,4,5,6,7};
nurn [1]	=[1] num ?cout<<”success” : cout<<"Errior";

ans
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};
    num[1] = 1 ? std::cout << "success" : std::cout << "error";
    return 0;
}


3. identify the error in the following program. 
#include<iostream.h>
void main() I
 switch(1)
{
defaul tt
case 4: 
case 5:
break.; 
case 1
continue;
case 2; case 3; break;
i--;
}
}

ans

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    switch (1) {
        default:
            break;
        case 4:
        case 5:
            break;
        case 1:
            continue;
        case 2:
        case 3:
            break;
    }
    
}


4. Identify the error in the following program.
#include<iostream.h>
#define pi 3.14
 int squareArea(int &);
int circlearea(int &) ; 
voi d main()
{
int a=10;
cout<< squareArea(A);
cout<< circleArea(a) ;
cout<<a<< endl ;
}
int squareArea(int &a)
{
return a *== a;
}
int circleArea(int &r)
{
return r = pi*r*r;
)

ans:
#include <iostream>
#define pi 3.14

int squareArea(int&);
float circleArea(int&);

int main()
{
    int a = 10;
    std::cout << squareArea(a) << std::endl;
    std::cout << circleArea(a) << std::endl;
    std::cout << a << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

int squareArea(int& a)
{
    return a * a;
}

float circleArea(int& r)
{

5.  Find errors, if any, in the following c++ statements.
(a) long Boat x.;
(b) char *cp = vp;	
(c)	int  code=three;	 
(d)	int *p=new;	
(e)	int const *p=total
(g)	coast int  array_size;
(h)         int & nurnber = 100;
(i) float p=2345;
(j) int else=234;
(k) char a=’welcome’;

ANS

a) There should be no space between "Boat" and "x", and the dot (".") should be removed. It should be: long int x;

(b) The pointer "vp" is not declared or initialized. It should be: char *cp = nullptr; or char *cp = some_valid_address; where "some_valid_address" is a valid address in memory.

(c) "three" is not a valid integer value. It should be replaced with a valid integer value.

(d) "new" is not used correctly. It should be followed by the type of object to be created using dynamic memory allocation, like "new int" or "new float[]".

(e) The variable name "p" is already used for a pointer. It should have a different name, like "q". Also, since the pointer is pointing to a constant integer, the correct syntax would be: const int *q = &total; or int const *q = &total;.

(g) There is a typo in "coast", which should be "const". Also, the variable "array_size" is not initialized. It should be initialized to a valid integer value, like: const int array_size = 10;.

(h) A reference variable cannot be initialized with a constant value. It should be initialized with a variable, like: int number = 100; int &reference = number;.

(i) The variable "p" is declared as a float, but is initialized with an integer value. It should be: float p = 2345.0;.

(j) "else" is a reserved keyword in C++ and cannot be used as a variable name. It should be renamed to something else.

(k) The variable "a" is declared as a char, but is initialized with a string value. It should be a character, like: char a = 'w';.
